# Brazilian E-Commerce Business Analysis

Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform connecting small and medium-sized merchants to online marketplaces.
This project analyzes historical transaction data to identify sales trends, customer behavior patterns, and regional performance differences in support of business decision-making.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist, which contains 100K anonymized data on orders, customers, products, and payments from 2016 to 2018.

## Tools
- SQL: Data extraction and integration
- Python: Exploratory data analysis and customer behavior analysis
- Tableau: Interactive dashboard for business insights

## Key Business Questions
1. How have revenue and order volume evolved over time?
2. Which product categories contribute most to total revenue?
3. How does purchasing behavior differ between new and returning customers?
4. What is the customer repeat purchase rate and return timing?
5. Are there significant regional differences in sales performance?

## Key Insights
- Revenue growth is primarily driven by increasing order volume rather than higher average order value.
- Revenue is overwhelmingly driven by new customers, highlighting an opportunity to improve customer retention.
- A small number of product categories account for a large share of total revenue (Top 16 categories cover 80% revenue).
